# OverengineeredCalculator

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 7.3.2.

[Read the CLI generated README](README.autogenerated.md) for instructions on how to set up the project.

## General

The calculator was built with Angular, which is my preferred tool when working with Firebase. Because of the package @angular/fire which is maintained by google. The integration in seemless, furthermore I really enjoy TypeScript.
Instead of using Firebase as the REST service requested, I took the liberty to use the previously mentioned SDK instead.

Just for kicks, the calculation is done twice. Once on the client and afterwards with a Cloud function.

## Issues not adressed:
* No code is testable as of right now, I wrongfully posponed but i cloudn't get jasmine to cooporate. All UI + firebase integration was built prior to logic.
* Because of missing tests the logic has bugs, few known already.
* Doesn't play well on mobile.
* When using keyboard, no visible feedback on which button was "clicked"
* Firestore is WIDE open, but this beeing a sandbox project with no billing, we will not adress this. Implementing authorization is out of scope.

## Known bugs
1. Leading zeroes (eval)
2. double operators (eval)
3. decimal has no restrictions (ui + eval)
4. cloud functions evaluation and client side doesn't always generate the same result. (they get different data)
